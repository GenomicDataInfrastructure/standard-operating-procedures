# This workflow lints the SOPs within the 'sops/' directory.
# The logic of this workflow is:
#   - Details: ZH-268
#   - Why: helps maintain consistency of SOPs, both in format and content
#   - Would block the PR if failed? If the mode is not strict, all errors
#       should be addressed before merging with 'main'
#   - How: calls the linter class 'SOPLinter' within 'sop_linter.py'
