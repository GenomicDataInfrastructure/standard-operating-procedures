# Copying GDI SOP repository
The GDI SOP repository ([**GenomicDataInfrastructure/standard-operating-procedures**](https://github.com/GenomicDataInfrastructure/standard-operating-procedures)) contains both European-level SOP _instances_ and Node-specific SOP _templates_. In order to adapt the Node-specific SOP templates, GDI nodes are expected to make a copy of this GitHub repository and modify them to suit them to their needs.

If you are a member of GDI, you are welcome to go through the [**recorded session**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DMbFP1xwu48aOPARTK2y_IVjFYt1bz10/view?usp=drive_link) where we covered this introduction.

Given that the base repository is public, forks of this repository cannot be private. Therefore, making a node's copy of the repository can be done in different ways, explained in this document, depending on the level of privacy that each node may require:
- **Public node's repository**. If the node does not require a private repository, copying the source repository is straightforward. See section _[1. Public repository](#1-public-repository)_.
- **Private node's repository**. On the contrary, if nodes need their SOP instances to be private (e.g. for security reasons), an alternative route is taken. See section _[2. Private repository](#2-private-repository)_.

## 1. Public repository
Here, we provide step-by-step instructions for **forking** a GitHub repository using GitHub's user interface.

### 1.1 Creating a fork repository

1. Open [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in to your account.
1. Go to [GDI SOP repository](https://github.com/GenomicDataInfrastructure/standard-operating-procedures) page.
1. Click the "Fork" button in the upper-right corner of the repository page.
1. Provide the details of your **forked repository**: 
    - Choose as owner your GitHub account or organization to create the fork. This repository will be your node's instance of the ``standard-operating-procedures``. Therefore, we recommend you to use your organization's namespace (similar to [GenomicDataInfrastructure](https://github.com/GenomicDataInfrastructure) but for your specific organization), as the repository ``Owner``, instead of your own username. 
    - Provide the name and description that you see fit. We recommend to use the default ones.
1. Click on "Create fork" and wait a few moments.

### 1.2 Work with Your Fork
1. Navigate to your forked repository. It will have your username or organization name at the beginning of the URL (``https://github.com/<your-username>/standard-operating-procedures``).
1. Clone the fork to your local machine:
    ````bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/standard-operating-procedures.git
    cd standard-operating-procedures
    ````
    Remember to replace ``<your-username>`` with the name that you used as "Owner" when forking.
1. **Start making changes to the existing SOP Templates**, the [node-specific](../sops/node-specific/), creating your node's instance of the SOPs to make them useful for your node.

## 2. Private repository

This rubric guides project partners through the steps to create a **private repository from a public GitHub repository** and maintain synchronization with the original source.

### 2.1 Create a Private Repository

1. Open [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in to your account.
1. Click on "[New Repository](https://github.com/new)".
1. Click on "[Import a repository](https://github.com/new/import)".
1. Follow the instructions to import a repository:
    1. Enter the URL of the **source repository**:
        ```markdown
        https://github.com/GenomicDataInfrastructure/standard-operating-procedures
        ```
    1. Enter the details of the **new repository**. 
        - This repository will be your node's instance of the ``standard-operating-procedures``. Therefore, we recommend you to use your organization's namespace (similar to [GenomicDataInfrastructure](https://github.com/GenomicDataInfrastructure) but for your specific organization), as the repository ``Owner``, instead of your own username. 
        - You can choose any name for the new repository (recommended: ``standard-operating-procedures``)
        - Choose "Private" as your new repository's privacy level. Otherwise, we advise you to follow section _[1. Public repository](#1-public-repository)_.
    
        Since the source repository is public, no credentials are needed to copy it.
1. Click "Begin Import". Wait for a few moments while GitHub imports the repository.

### 2.3 Add Upstream Remote and Disable Pushing
Once your repository has been imported, we are ready to **set the source repository as the upstream remote**. This is for your repository (called ``origin``) to track changes in the source repository (called ``upstream``):
1. **Clone your new private repository** to your local machine:
    ````bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/standard-operating-procedures.git
    cd standard-operating-procedures
    ````
    Remember to replace ``<your-username>`` with either your organization's namespace or your GitHub username, whichever you used as "Owner" when importing.
1. Add the **public repository as an upstream remote**:
    ````bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/GenomicDataInfrastructure/standard-operating-procedures.git
    ````
1. **Disable pushing to the upstream repository** to avoid accidental changes to the public repository:
    ````bash
    git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLE
    ````

If everything was correctly set, you should see something similar to the following:
````bash
$ git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:<your-username>/standard-operating-procedures.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:<your-username>/standard-operating-procedures.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/GenomicDataInfrastructure/standard-operating-procedures.git (fetch)
upstream        DISABLE (push)
````

### 2.4 Sync with Upstream
Whenever there are changes in the source repository, you can **sync your node's repository**:
1. **Fetch updates** from the public repository (upstream):
    ````bash
    git fetch upstream
    ````
1. **Merge or rebase** the changes from the upstream repository. If there are conflicts, we advise you to resolve them them manually.
    1. Merge:
        ````bash
        git merge upstream/main --no-edit
        ````
    1. Rebase:
        ````bash
        git rebase upstream/main
        ````
### 2.5 Work with your private copy
You are ready to make any changes the existing SOP Templates, the [node-specific](../sops/node-specific/), creating your node's instance of the SOPs to make them useful for your node.
