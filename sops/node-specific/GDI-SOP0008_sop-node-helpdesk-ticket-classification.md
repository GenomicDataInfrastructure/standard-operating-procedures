| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Node Helpdesk | The support team is responsible for handling tickets related to data management issues associated with the node in the GDI Project.  |
| Ticket | Incoming issues from the GDI Virtual Helpdesk, are to be processed within the Node Helpdesk and, after that, returned to the Virtual Helpdesk |
| Ticket Classification | The process of categorising support requests is based on their nature so that they can be assigned to the appropriate individual or team for resolution.  |
| Virtual Helpdesk  | The initial point of contact for inquiries and requests related to data management in the GDI project. |

### 4. Purpose

Each GDI Node Helpdesk (NHD) provides support to its users by using a dedicated system (ticket management system) to respond to users with various issues or requests.

The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to provide clear guidelines for classifying tickets in a consistent and efficient manner in the node’s dedicated system. Proper ticket classification ensures that requests are routed to the appropriate teams, and prioritised accurately. This SOP aims to optimize resource allocation, improve response time and enhance overall customer satisfaction.

### 5. Scope

This SOP outlines the process for classifying tickets at the **node level** received from the Virtual Helpdesk (VHD) using a classification model and registering them in the node's internal ticket management system. The SOP covers all steps, from the reference of the ticket from the VHD to its categorisation of a corresponding issue in the dedicated system.

### 6. Introduction and Background Information

This SOP applies to all tickets forwarded by the VHD that involve data management issues specific to the node. The NHD serves as the primary point of contact for addressing inquiries and requests received from the VHD concerning data management within the node. The NHD is responsible for collaborating with the VHD to ensure proper ticket classification, effective coordination, and timely resolution of these issues.

Below is defined the importance of creating custom tags for the ticket management system:

- **Classification and Prioritisation:** Tags help sort and prioritise tickets based on specific attributes or statuses.

- **Targeted Searches and Reports:** Tags enable precise filtering and custom reporting, focusing on relevant ticket aspects.

- **Enhanced Communication and Coordination:** Tags clarify ticket statuses and denote special handling requirements, improving team communication.

- **Streamlined Workflows:** Tags support automated workflows and ensure consistent ticket management practices.

- **Tracking and Reporting**: Tags aid in tracking performance metrics and analysing ticket trends for process improvements.	

- **Increased Efficiency:** Tags facilitate quick access to tickets and enable focused resolution of critical issues.

### 8. Procedure

#### 8.1. Evaluating a Ticket from the VHD

| Step identifier | When | Who |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ``1`` | After receiving a ticket from the VHD, within xx working days | Helpdesk officer  |

The NHD receives a ticket from the VHD requiring action by the specific node. Using a node-specific checklist, the ticket is evaluated to determine whether it is within the scope (positive evaluation) of the node or not (negative evaluation).

#### 8.1.1.  Positive Evaluation - Proceeding with the Ticket**

| Step identifier | When | Who |
|:---|:---|:---|
|  ``1.1`` | After step 1, if the evaluation is positive, within xx working days| Helpdesk officer |

If the ticket is within the scope of the NHD, a **new issue** will be created in the **dedicated system** to record the ticket's arrival and document the positive evaluation. Each ticket will be assigned **four tags** from the [provided list. ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KTAfpV5qLH9YTs8IXZWGXe_9InQg2ID3pAxWqoULrDU/edit?tab=t.0)

**Tags**: Assign these four tags to each ticket:

1. **Type**: Specifies the type of ticket.

2. **Priority**: Specifies the ticket's priority level.

3. **Assignee**: Specifies who is responsible for the ticket.

4. **Status**: Specifies the ticket's status (initially set to "New").

#### 8.1.2.  Negative Evaluation - Closing the Ticket

| Step identifier | When | Who |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ``1.2.1`` | After step 1, if the evaluation is negative, within xx working days | Helpdesk officer |

If the ticket is out of the scope of the NHD, a new issue will be created in the designated system to record the ticket's arrival and document the negative evaluation.

| Step identifier | When | Who |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ``1.2.2`` | After creating a new issue in the dedicated system and documenting the negative evaluation | Helpdesk officer |

The VHD will be informed that the issue is not within the scope of the NHD. A brief explanation for this decision will be provided.

| Step identifier | When | Who |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ``1.2.3`` | After informing the VHD about the negative evaluation of the issue  | Helpdesk officer |

The ticket will be closed in the node’s ticketing system, with a clear note stating why the ticket was closed.
